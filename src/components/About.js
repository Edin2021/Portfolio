        Hello, my name is Edin Sikira, I’m 20 years old and I am from Bosnia and
        Herzegovina. I am a self taught front end developer currently using the
        technologies mentioned above but I’m willing to learn what is necessary
        to complete the job and become better in this career. I have one year of
        experience in coding and solving front end problems. Please judge my
        level of experience based on the projects I have done.
