        Hello, my name is Edin Sikira, I’m 20 years old and I am from Bosnia and
        Herzegovina. I am a front end developer currently using the technologies
        mentioned above, but I’m willing to learn what's necessary to complete
        the job and become better in this career. With years of experience in
        coding and solving critical front end problems, I feel comfortable in
        most work environments. Feel free to send me a project type challenge to
        judge my level of experience, interviews are also welcome.
      </p>
